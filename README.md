## 1. Ranking top 5 exchanges trading DASH based on transparency

Based on the measures given by Nomics https://blog.nomics.com/essays/transparency-ratings/, we summarized its rating method, advantages and disadvantages, and would like to establish our own reliable and explicit ranking rules for cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Nomics' Exchanges Transparency Ratings

#### Historical Trade-Level Data
According to the examination of 10 trusted exchanges revealed by Bitwise, Nomics found eight of the 10 exchanges provide historical trade level data which is considered *the most granular and audible* form of data available. In contrast, for the exchanges called bad actors by Bitwise, every single one of them provides limited trading history and virtually no granularity around trading activity.

Nomics assign 7 types of transparency scores (A+,A,A-,B,C,D,F) to exchanges. The middle one is score B which represents a good exchange. For one to have rating B, it must provide, at the very least, this much candle history:
* 1-Day Candles: 7 candles with last candle occurring within a rolling 48 hours
* 1-Hour Candles: 24 candles with last candle occurring within a rolling 2 hours
* 1-Minute Candles: 60 candles with last candle occurring within a rolling 10 minutes

One advantage of Nomics ratings is that these are not subjective. They check their database and exchange APIs to determine the qualitiy of data. Meanwhile, Nomics says they have never charged for exchange listings. However, I think it is possible that the data obtained by exchange APIs is fake although exchanges release all historical data. Thus, we need to analyze data further and compare data from different exchanges to draw our final conlusions.
